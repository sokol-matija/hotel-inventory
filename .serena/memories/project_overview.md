## Technical Architecture
### Clean Architecture Implementation
The system demonstrates successful enterprise-grade clean architecture refactoring:
- **Strategic Refactoring Complete**: 7 major components refactored with 39% average line reduction
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic extracted into dedicated service classes
- **Custom Hooks**: State management consolidated into reusable hooks (300+ lines per hook)
- **Component Simplification**: UI components focused purely on presentation
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strict typing with advanced utility types and branded types

### Major Refactoring Achievements
- **CreateBookingModal**: 1,061 → 354 lines (67% reduction)
- **LocationDetail**: 928 → 525 lines (43% reduction)  
- **ReservationPopup**: 810 → 495 lines (39% reduction)
- **OrdersPage**: 577 → 275 lines (52% reduction)
- **HotelTimeline**: 2,591 → 2,457 lines (5% reduction)
- **EmailTestPage**: 645 → 458 lines (29% reduction)
- **Total Impact**: 1,372 lines removed, 39% average reduction

## Business Domain Context
### Real Hotel Operations
- **Hotel Porec Integration**: Actual business data, Croatian OIB (87246357068), real seasonal pricing
- **Croatian Fiscal Compliance**: Complete Tax Authority integration with FINA certificate handling
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Euro pricing with Croatian kuna tax calculations and tourism tax
- **Professional Communication**: Multi-language guest communication with hotel branding
- **Real-Time Operations**: Room 401 special notifications, occupancy management, conflict resolution

### Complex Business Logic

- **✅ Business Logic**: All hotel operations fully functional with proper error handling
- **✅ Croatian Compliance**: Fiscal system operational with resolved Tax Authority integration
- **✅ Mobile Integration**: Complete NTFY notification system with setup documentation

### Ready for Next Phase
- **Service Layer Foundation**: Data access already abstracted through service classes
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Hotel management types ready for PostgreSQL schema mapping
- **Multi-User Architecture**: Professional hotel operations require shared data persistence
- **Real-Time Requirements**: Reservation conflicts and occupancy updates need live synchronization

## Development Priorities
1. **Supabase Migration** (Immediate): Move hotel data from localStorage to PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions
2. **Multi-User Support**: Enable collaborative hotel staff operations with proper data synchronization
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced responsive design for hotel staff mobile device usage
4. **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling and code splitting for large data sets
5. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for booking workflow and fiscal compliance
