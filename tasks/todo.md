# Hotel Porec Data Structure Testing Plan

## Test Objectives
Test the complete Hotel Porec data structure implementation to ensure it's ready for calendar integration.

## Test Plan Tasks

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Test
- [ ] Verify `src/lib/hotel/types.ts` compiles without errors
- [ ] Verify `src/lib/hotel/hotelData.ts` compiles without errors  
- [ ] Verify `src/lib/hotel/pricingCalculator.ts` compiles without errors
- [ ] Verify `src/lib/hotel/sampleData.ts` compiles without errors
- [ ] Run full TypeScript build to ensure no dependency errors

### 2. Data Structure Validation Test
- [ ] Examine hotel types and interfaces in `types.ts`
- [ ] Verify Hotel Porec has exactly 46 rooms configured in `hotelData.ts`
- [ ] Check room categorization (standard, family, luxury, etc.) 
- [ ] Validate room amenities and pricing structures
- [ ] Test room availability and booking status data

### 3. Pricing Calculator Test
- [ ] Test Croatian tax calculations (VAT rates)
- [ ] Verify seasonal pricing adjustments work
- [ ] Test peak/off-peak pricing logic
- [ ] Validate currency formatting (HRK/EUR)
- [ ] Test discount calculations if present

### 4. Sample Data Test
- [ ] Verify guest data generation works correctly
- [ ] Test reservation data structure and dates
- [ ] Check guest profiles have proper fields
- [ ] Validate reservation-room associations
- [ ] Test check-in/check-out date logic

### 5. Integration Test
- [ ] Test importing hotel data in components
- [ ] Verify data can be consumed by calendar views
- [ ] Check TypeScript type safety across imports
- [ ] Test data transformation for UI components
- [ ] Validate no circular dependencies

### 6. Performance & Memory Test
- [ ] Check data loading performance
- [ ] Verify memory usage is reasonable for 46 rooms
- [ ] Test data caching if implemented
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in sample data generation

## Files Being Tested
- `src/lib/hotel/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `src/lib/hotel/hotelData.ts` - Hotel Porec configuration (46 rooms)
- `src/lib/hotel/pricingCalculator.ts` - Croatian tax and pricing logic
- `src/lib/hotel/sampleData.ts` - Sample guests and reservations

## Success Criteria
- All TypeScript files compile without errors
- Hotel Porec has exactly 46 rooms properly configured
- Croatian tax calculations work correctly
- Sample data generates valid guest and reservation objects
- Data can be successfully imported and used in React components
- No performance issues with the data structures
