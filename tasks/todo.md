# Hotel Management Tasks

## Current Feature: Front Desk Bar/Restaurant Ordering System 🔄

### Summary
Implement a front desk ordering system that allows staff to order drinks and food items from inventory for hotel rooms, automatically deduct from inventory, add charges to room bills, and print receipts using Bixolon printer.

### Todo List

#### ✅ 1. Research current inventory and bar system
- [x] Analyze existing inventory database structure
- [x] Review items, categories, and inventory tables
- [x] Check pricing and quantity tracking system
- [x] Understand current inventory location system

#### 🔄 2. Design front desk ordering interface
- [ ] Create "Room Service Orders" component for front desk
- [ ] Filter inventory items by food/beverage categories
- [ ] Show available quantities and prices
- [ ] Allow quantity selection and room assignment
- [ ] Add order summary with total calculation

#### 📋 3. Implement order processing logic
- [ ] Create order data structure and types
- [ ] Implement inventory deduction functionality
- [ ] Add order validation (check stock availability)
- [ ] Create order history tracking
- [ ] Handle out-of-stock scenarios gracefully

#### 💰 4. Integrate with room billing system
- [ ] Add charges to existing room reservations
- [ ] Create separate "immediate payment" option
- [ ] Update hotel context with order/charge functionality
- [ ] Link orders to reservation payment tracking
- [ ] Update checkout workflow to include room service charges

#### 🖨️ 5. Research and implement Bixolon printer integration
- [ ] Research Bixolon printer integration methods (USB/Network/Bluetooth)
- [ ] Investigate if it works like standard printer with smaller format
- [ ] Create receipt template for bar/restaurant orders
- [ ] Implement print functionality for orders
- [ ] Test receipt formatting and printer communication

#### 🧪 6. Integration and testing
- [ ] Add ordering interface to Front Desk module
- [ ] Test inventory deduction accuracy
- [ ] Verify room charge integration
- [ ] Test receipt printing workflow
- [ ] Handle edge cases (insufficient stock, payment failures)

## Technical Approach

### Database Integration:
- Use existing `items`, `categories`, `inventory` tables
- Filter categories for food/beverage items only
- Real-time inventory quantity updates
- Track orders in new `room_service_orders` table (if needed)

### Bixolon Printer Research:
Bixolon printers typically work in several ways:
1. **Network Printing**: ESC/POS commands over IP
2. **USB Connection**: Standard printer driver (smaller format)
3. **Bluetooth**: Mobile printing via special SDKs
4. **Web Printing**: Browser-based printing with special formatting

Most likely approach: **ESC/POS commands** for receipt formatting or **standard browser printing** with CSS @media print rules for small format.

### Order Workflow:
1. **Front desk selects room** → Shows guest info
2. **Browse food/drink items** → Filter by categories, show prices/stock
3. **Add items to order** → Quantity selection, running total
4. **Choose payment method**: 
   - Add to room bill (pay at checkout)
   - Immediate payment (cash/card)
5. **Process order** → Deduct inventory, create charges, print receipt
6. **Deliver to room** → Order tracking/completion

### Files to Create/Modify:
- `src/components/hotel/frontdesk/RoomService/` - New ordering interface
- `src/lib/hotel/orderService.ts` - Order processing logic  
- `src/lib/printers/bixolonPrinter.ts` - Printer integration
- `src/components/hotel/frontdesk/FrontDeskLayout.tsx` - Add ordering tab
- Hotel context updates for order management

### Expected Features:
- 🛎️ **Room service ordering** from front desk
- 📦 **Real-time inventory tracking** with automatic deduction
- 💰 **Flexible payment options** (room bill vs immediate)
- 🧾 **Professional receipt printing** for guests
- 📊 **Order history and tracking** for hotel management
- ⚡ **Fast, intuitive interface** for busy front desk staff

## Previous Completed Task: Unavailable Dates Calendar Implementation ✅

### Summary
Implemented smart date picker that shows unavailable dates for specific rooms with red X overlays and automatically limits check-out date selection based on next occupied date.

#### ✅ 1. Research current booking system
- [x] Understand CreateBookingModal structure and date inputs
- [x] Analyze Reservation interface and data structure  
- [x] Review existing calendar utility functions
- [x] Check HotelContext for reservation management

#### ✅ 2. Create occupied dates utility function
- [x] Create `getRoomOccupiedDates` function to fetch dates for a specific room
- [x] Function should return array of Date objects that are occupied
- [x] Handle different reservation statuses (exclude checked-out)
- [x] Add function to hotel calendar utilities

#### ✅ 3. Implement smart date picker component
- [x] Create `SmartDatePicker` component to replace basic date inputs
- [x] Add red X overlay styling for unavailable dates
- [x] Integrate with existing form data structure
- [x] Support min date validation (today's date)

#### ✅ 4. Add check-out date limitation logic
- [x] When check-in date selected, calculate maximum available check-out date
- [x] Find next occupied date after check-in to set limit
- [x] Update check-out field max attribute dynamically
- [x] Prevent double booking scenarios

#### ✅ 5. Integration and testing
- [x] Update CreateBookingModal to use new SmartDatePicker
- [x] Test with existing sample reservations
- [x] Verify date conflict detection still works
- [x] Test edge cases (same-day checkout/checkin, long stays)

#### ✅ 6. Enhanced Calendar Implementation
- [x] Created CalendarDatePicker component with visual calendar popup
- [x] Completely prevents selection of occupied dates (not just warnings)
- [x] Added proper visual feedback with red X marks and disabled states
- [x] Integrated month navigation and date selection logic

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 🚀 Feature Completed: Smart Date Picker with Unavailable Dates

**What was implemented:**
1. **New Utility Functions** (`src/lib/hotel/calendarUtils.ts`):
   - `getRoomOccupiedDates()` - Fetches all occupied dates for a specific room
   - `getMaxCheckoutDate()` - Calculates maximum checkout date based on next reservation
   - `isDateAvailableForRoom()` - Checks if a specific date is available

## Previous Completed Task: Payment and Invoice System

### Previous Issue Analysis
- When creating booking, payment status shows as "paid" already instead of "pending"
- Need to reuse existing payment information view on in-house module  
- Add PDF invoice button to existing payment breakdown view

### Previous Implementation ✅
- **Fixed Payment Status Logic**: New reservations now default to 'incomplete-payment'
- **Enhanced Checkout Process**: Added payment status display and PDF generation
- **Consolidated Finance Module**: Merged invoice and payment management
- **Real Hotel Operations Workflow**: Check-in → Stay → Checkout with payment → Finance tracking

**Status**: In Progress - Bar/Restaurant Ordering System  
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Medium-High (Printer integration adds complexity)
