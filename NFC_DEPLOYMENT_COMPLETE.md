## 📝 How to Test Now

### Method 1: Browser Frontend (Recommended)

1. **Add route to App.tsx:**
```typescript
import { NFCCleanRoomPage } from '@/components/testing/NFCCleanRoomPage'

<Route path="/nfc/clean" element={<NFCCleanRoomPage />} />
```

2. **Test in browser:**
```
http://localhost:3000/nfc/clean?roomId=101
```

3. **You'll see:**
   - Loading spinner (2 seconds)
   - ✅ Green success page: "Room 101 marked as clean"
   - Database updated instantly

---

### Method 2: From NFC Tag (When Ready)

Each NFC tag should contain:
```
https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=101
```

When tapped:
1. Phone opens URL
2. Browser loads `/nfc/clean?roomId=101`
3. Frontend page shows success
4. Room marked clean

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Architecture
```
NFC Tag (physical)
  ↓
Contains URL with room number
  ↓
Phone taps tag
  ↓
Browser opens URL
  ↓
NFCCleanRoomPage component loads
  ↓
Component extracts roomId from URL
  ↓
Calls Supabase Edge Function
  ↓
Edge Function:
  - Finds room by number (101, 102, etc)
  - Updates is_cleaned = true
  - Returns success
  ↓
Frontend shows ✅ success page
  ↓
Room is clean!
```

## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test 1: Room 101
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/nfc/clean?roomId=101
Expected: ✅ Room 101 marked as clean
```

### Test 2: Room 102
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/nfc/clean?roomId=102
Expected: ✅ Room 102 marked as clean
```

### Test 3: Invalid Room
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/nfc/clean?roomId=999
Expected: ❌ Room 999 not found
```

## 📱 Real-World Usage

### Staff Workflow
1. Housekeeping finishes cleaning room 101
2. Taps NFC tag on door with phone
3. Browser opens automatically

6. Dashboard shows: Room 101 is ✅ Clean
7. Manager can assign next guest

**Total time: 3 seconds per room**
