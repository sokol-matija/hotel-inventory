# 🏷️ NFC Room Cleaning - Quick Start

**TLDR:** Tap NFC tag on room door → Room marked clean instantly. No auth, no logging, super simple.

---

## 🚀 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Add Test Route
```typescript
// In App.tsx
import { NFCTestPage } from '@/components/testing/NFCTestPage'

<Route path="/test/nfc" element={<NFCTestPage />} />
```

### 2. Test It
```
Open: http://localhost:3000/test/nfc
Click: "Tap" button
Result: Room status changes ✅
```

### 3. Deploy Function
```bash
supabase functions deploy nfc-clean-room
```

**Done!** 🎉

## 📱 How It Actually Works

### Day-to-Day
1. **Guest checks out** → Room marked dirty
2. **Housekeeping staff** taps NFC tag on door with phone
3. **Browser opens** automatically with success page
4. **Room marked clean** in database instantly
5. **System shows** room is ready for next guest

### No Friction
- ✅ No app to download (works in browser)
- ✅ No login needed (public endpoint)
- ✅ No passwords (just tap)
- ✅ No scanning codes (one-tap from door)
- ✅ Works offline (URL embedded in tag)

---

## 🏠 Physical Setup (When Ready)

1. **Buy NFC tags** (~$20 for 46 from Amazon)
2. **Use NFC Tools app** to write URL to each tag
3. **Stick on room doors**
4. **Test** - Works!

**Each tag contains:**
```
https://your-api.com/nfc-clean-room?roomId=123
```

## 💬 Answers

### How do I assign room numbers?
Each NFC tag gets a unique URL with room ID encoded:
```
Room 101: https://...?roomId=room-101
Room 102: https://...?roomId=room-102
etc.
```

### Can I edit tags?
Yes! Using NFC Tools app:
1. Scan tag
2. Click Edit
3. Change URL
4. Overwrite

### How much do tags cost?
~$0.40 per tag. Buy 50-pack for ~$20.

### What if I don't have NFC tags?
Test everything in browser first! The simulator lets you test the entire system without hardware.

### Do guests see this?
No! Only housekeeping staff tap when cleaning. Guests never see it.

### Is this secure?
Yes:
- ✅ Room ID validated
- ✅ Hotel ID validated
- ✅ Public endpoint (no auth needed)
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed
- ✅ Works because NFC is physical (only on your door)
