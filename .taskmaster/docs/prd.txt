# Product Requirements Document - Hotel Inventory Management System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive hotel management system built with React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, and modern web technologies.

## Current Status
- ✅ Advanced Backend Integration (v2.7)
- ✅ Enterprise User Experience Features
- ✅ Phobs Channel Manager Integration
- ✅ Real-time Conflict Detection
- ✅ Optimistic UI Updates
- ✅ Batch Operations Support
- ✅ Keyboard Shortcuts (20+ hotkeys)

## Core Modules

### 1. Front Desk Module
- Hotel Timeline with drag-and-drop reservations
- Real-time booking conflict detection
- Room cleaning status tracking
- Automated daily status reset
- Guest check-in/check-out management
- Context menu operations

### 2. Finance Module
- Invoice generation and management
- Payment tracking
- Revenue reporting
- Integration with external systems

### 3. Channel Manager Integration (Phobs)
- Real-time OTA synchronization
- Bidirectional reservation sync
- Conflict resolution (double bookings, rate mismatches)
- Performance monitoring
- Error handling with retry logic
- Multi-channel support (Booking.com, Expedia, etc.)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- React 19 (with Server Components patterns)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- React Router v7
- React DnD (drag and drop)
- GSAP (animations)
- i18next (internationalization: EN, DE, HR, IT)

### Backend Stack
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
- Supabase Edge Functions
- Real-time subscriptions
- Row Level Security (RLS)

### Service Layer Architecture
1. **ConflictDetectionService**: Real-time booking validation
2. **OptimisticUpdateService**: Instant UI feedback with rollback
3. **BatchOperationService**: Bulk operations management
4. **KeyboardShortcutService**: Context-aware hotkeys
5. **PhobsChannelManagerService**: OTA integration
6. **PhobsErrorHandlingService**: Error handling with retry logic
7. **PhobsReservationSyncService**: Bidirectional sync

## Development Guidelines
- Zero TypeScript errors maintained
- Service layer abstraction for business logic
- Optimistic updates for all user actions
- Comprehensive error handling and rollback
- Senior-level code quality standards
- Test-driven development approach

## Future Enhancements
