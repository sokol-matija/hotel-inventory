## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Service Layer Hierarchy

```
Application Layer (Components)
    ‚Üì
Business Service Layer
    ‚Üì 
Data Access Layer (DatabaseAdapter)
    ‚Üì
External Services (Supabase, Phobs, Email, Fiscal)
```

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: All services use singleton instances for global state management
- **Adapter Pattern**: DatabaseAdapter abstracts current schema from application expectations  
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time services with subscription management
- **Command Pattern**: Batch operations and optimistic updates
- **Strategy Pattern**: Conflict resolution with multiple strategies

## üìä Core Service Analysis

### 1. Hotel Data Service (`HotelDataService.ts`)
**Primary Responsibility**: Central data orchestration for hotel entities

**Class Exports**:
- `HotelDataService` (singleton)
- Methods: `getHotel()`, `getRooms()`, `getGuests()`, `getReservations()`, CRUD operations

**External Dependencies**:
- Supabase client for database operations
- DatabaseAdapter for schema mapping
- Hotel types from application layer

**Database Interactions**:
```typescript
// Room fetch with complex joins
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('rooms')
  .select(`
    *,
    room_type:room_types (
      code, name_croatian, name_english, max_occupancy, amenities
    )
  `)
  .eq('hotel_id', HOTEL_POREC_ID)
  .order('number');
```

**Business Logic**:
- Hotel-specific constants (`HOTEL_POREC_ID` as deterministic UUID)
- Room availability checking with date range queries
- Guest search by lastname with fuzzy matching
- Reservation conflict detection in date ranges

**Performance Considerations**:
- Uses separate queries to avoid JOIN issues
- Implements lookup maps for data association
- Delegates complex operations to DatabaseAdapter

**Potential Improvements**:
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Implement connection pooling for high-concurrency scenarios
- Add data validation schemas with Zod

### 2. Database Adapter (`DatabaseAdapter.ts`)
**Primary Responsibility**: Schema mapping between current database and application expectations

**Class Exports**:
- `DatabaseAdapter` (singleton)
- `databaseAdapter` instance export

**External Dependencies**:
- Supabase client
- Application type definitions

**Database Interactions**:
- Complex reservation queries with guest/room joins
- Separate entity fetches to avoid JOIN complexity
- Bulk insert operations for reservations

**Business Logic**:
- Maps current flat database structure to expected nested format
- Handles room type code translations (BD ‚Üí big-double)
- Generates confirmation numbers with hotel prefix
- Provides Croatian/English room name translations

**Integration Points**:
- Used by ConflictDetectionService for conflict checking
- Integrated with HotelDataService as primary data layer

### 3. Channel Manager Service (`PhobsChannelManagerService.ts`)
**Primary Responsibility**: OTA integration and reservation synchronization

**Class Exports**:
- `PhobsChannelManagerService` (singleton)
- Interfaces: `ApiResponse`, `AuthenticationResult`, `ConnectionTestResult`

**External Dependencies**:
- PhobsErrorHandlingService for retry logic
- Hotel notification system
- PhobsTypes for comprehensive type definitions

**Database Interactions**:
- No direct database calls (delegates to HotelDataService)
- Webhook processing for incoming OTA reservations

**Business Logic**:
- Multi-channel OTA synchronization (Booking.com, Expedia, Airbnb, etc.)
- Bidirectional reservation sync with conflict resolution
- Availability and rate synchronization across channels
- Webhook processing for real-time updates
- Authentication token management with auto-refresh

**Performance Considerations**:
- Parallel channel synchronization
- Retry queue for failed operations

- Detailed error logging with operation context

### 4. Conflict Detection Service (`ConflictDetectionService.ts`)
**Primary Responsibility**: Real-time booking conflict prevention

**Class Exports**:
- `ConflictDetectionService` (singleton)
- Interfaces: `ConflictResult`, `BookingConflict`, `BookingWarning`, `BookingSuggestion`

**External Dependencies**:
- DatabaseAdapter for room/reservation queries
- Date-fns for date manipulation and validation

**Database Interactions**:
```typescript
// Sophisticated conflict detection query
const existingReservations = await this.databaseAdapter
  .getReservationsByRoomAndDateRange(
    roomId, 
    startOfDay(checkIn), 
    endOfDay(checkOut)
  );
```

**Business Logic**:
- Real-time conflict detection for new reservations
- Room availability validation with alternative suggestions

- Intelligent room upgrade suggestions
- Alternative room recommendations based on type and availability
- Context-aware validation (maintenance periods, business hours)

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Optimized date overlap calculations
- Minimal database queries with targeted filtering
- Efficient alternative room discovery

### 5. Optimistic Update Service (`OptimisticUpdateService.ts`)
**Primary Responsibility**: Instant UI feedback with automatic rollback

**Class Exports**:
- `OptimisticUpdateService` (singleton)
- Interfaces: `OptimisticOperation`, `RollbackResult`

**External Dependencies**:
- Hotel types for reservation operations

**Business Logic**:
- Instant UI updates for reservation operations (create, move, update, delete)
- Automatic rollback on server failures
- Operation tracking with status monitoring (pending, success, failed, rolled_back)
- Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms

**Key Features**:
```typescript
// Generic optimistic update pattern
async executeOptimisticUpdate<T>(
  operationId: string,
  operation: {
    optimisticUpdate: () => void;
    rollbackUpdate: () => void;
    serverUpdate: () => Promise<T>;

- Context-aware shortcuts (normal, drag, move, expand modes)
- Smart input field detection to prevent conflicts
- Four categories: navigation, modes, operations, accessibility

**Key Features**:
- Dynamic shortcut registration and management
- Help system with formatted display

- Mass cancellations with reason tracking
- Bulk reservation extensions (weather delays)
- Intelligent conflict resolution with multiple strategies

**Advanced Features**:
- Progress callbacks for real-time UI updates

## üö® Error Handling Patterns

### Service-Level Error Handling

1. **Tiered Error Strategy**:
   ```typescript
   // Service level - structured error responses
   return { success: false, error: 'Validation failed', details: errors };
   
   // Application level - user-friendly messages  
   showNotification('error', 'Unable to create reservation', 'Please try again');
   ```

2. **Resilience Patterns**:
   - Circuit breaker for external service calls
   - Retry with exponential backoff
   - Graceful degradation for non-critical features
   - Comprehensive logging with operation context

### Database Error Recovery

```typescript
// Automatic retry with fallback strategies
const { error } = await supabase.from('table').insert(data);
if (error?.message.includes('schema_mismatch')) {
  // Retry with alternative schema
  return await this.retryWithFallbackSchema(data);
}
```
