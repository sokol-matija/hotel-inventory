# 🏨 Hotel Database Strategic Migration - Master Execution Plan

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This plan implements a **clean slate database migration** that aligns the Supabase database with our sophisticated hotel management codebase. We're fixing the database to match the code (not the other way around) because the TypeScript implementation represents months of professional development work for comprehensive hotel management.

## 📊 CURRENT VS TARGET STATE

### Current Database Issues:
- ❌ Schema mismatches (`rooms.number` missing, no `hotel_id`)
- ❌ Failed JOIN operations
- ❌ Missing `room_types` table
- ❌ No pricing/fiscal tables
- ❌ Row-Level Security blocking operations

### Target Database Features:
- ✅ Complete hotel management schema (16 tables)
- ✅ Croatian fiscal compliance
- ✅ Corporate billing system
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions
- ✅ Development-friendly RLS policies
- ✅ 55 Hotel Porec rooms with realistic test data

## 🚀 EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### **PHASE 1: Pre-Migration Backup & Safety**

```bash
# 1. Backup current data (if valuable)
echo "Backing up existing data..."
# Note: Our analysis shows minimal data (6 guests, 2 reservations)
# But backup if you want to preserve anything

# 2. Test environment verification
echo "Verifying we're in development environment..."
```

### **PHASE 2: Execute Database Schema Migration**

**Execute:** `strategic-database-migration.sql`

```bash
# Apply the comprehensive schema migration
mcp__supabase__apply_migration "hotel_schema_foundation" "$(cat docs/strategic-database-migration.sql)"
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Creates/updates 16 hotel management tables
- ✅ Adds missing columns to existing tables
- ✅ Sets up Croatian fiscal compliance structure  
- ✅ Creates proper relationships and indexes
- ✅ Adds update triggers for audit trails

**Expected Duration:** 2-3 minutes

### **PHASE 3: Populate Hotel Porec Configuration**

**Execute:** `strategic-test-data-insertion.sql`

```bash
# Insert Hotel Porec configuration and test data
mcp__supabase__apply_migration "hotel_porec_data" "$(cat docs/strategic-test-data-insertion.sql)"
```

**What this creates:**
- 🏨 Hotel Porec configuration
- 🏠 8 room types (BD, BS, D, T, S, F, A, RA)
- 🏢 55 rooms across 4 floors (exact localStorage pattern)
- 💰 2026 pricing with seasonal periods A/B/C/D
- 🇭🇷 Croatian fee structure (tourism tax, VAT, etc.)
- 👥 8 realistic test guests
- 📅 3 test reservations (current, upcoming, past)

**Expected Duration:** 1-2 minutes

### **PHASE 4: Configure Development-Friendly RLS**

**Execute:** `development-rls-configuration.sql`

```bash
# Set up Row-Level Security for development
mcp__supabase__apply_migration "development_rls" "$(cat docs/development-rls-configuration.sql)"
```

**What this configures:**
- 🔓 Permissive policies for development testing
- 📺 Real-time publication for live updates
- 🔍 Anonymous access for testing (development only)
- 🚀 Ready for production tightening later

**Expected Duration:** 30 seconds

## 🧪 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After executing all migrations, verify the setup:

### **1. Schema Verification**

```sql
-- Verify room count by floor
SELECT floor, COUNT(*) as room_count 
FROM rooms 
WHERE hotel_id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000' 
GROUP BY floor 
ORDER BY floor;
-- Expected: Floor 1=18, Floor 2=18, Floor 3=18, Floor 4=1

-- Verify room types distribution
SELECT rt.name_english, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM rooms r 
JOIN room_types rt ON r.room_type_id = rt.id 
WHERE r.hotel_id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000' 
GROUP BY rt.name_english 
ORDER BY count DESC;
-- Expected: Double=39, Triple=12, Family=3, Single=3, Rooftop=1
```

### **2. Data Verification**

```sql
-- Verify test guests
SELECT COUNT(*) as guest_count FROM guests;
-- Expected: 8 guests

-- Verify test reservations
SELECT r.confirmation_number, g.first_name, g.last_name, 
       rm.number as room, r.status, r.check_in, r.check_out
FROM reservations r
JOIN guests g ON r.primary_guest_id = g.id
JOIN rooms rm ON r.room_id = rm.id
WHERE r.hotel_id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
ORDER BY r.check_in;
-- Expected: 3 reservations with realistic dates and guests
```

### **3. Service Layer Verification**

```bash
# Test the service layer integration
npm test src/lib/hotel/services/__tests__/hotelDataService.integration.test.ts
```

### **4. Front-Desk UI Verification**

```bash
# Test front-desk components
npm test src/components/hotel/frontdesk/__tests__/FrontDeskComprehensive.test.tsx
```

## 🎯 BUSINESS LOGIC VERIFICATION

After migration, these features should work:

### **Core Hotel Operations:**
- ✅ Room availability checking
- ✅ Reservation creation and management
- ✅ Guest check-in/check-out workflows
- ✅ Drag-and-drop room changes
- ✅ Real-time reservation updates

### **Croatian Compliance:**
- ✅ Tourism tax calculation (€1.10-€1.60 per person/night)
- ✅ VAT handling (25% Croatian rate)
- ✅ Seasonal pricing (A/B/C/D periods)
- ✅ Children discounts (0-3: free, 3-7: 50%, 7-14: 20%)
- ✅ Pet fees (€20 per stay)
- ✅ Parking fees (€7 per night)

### **Corporate Features:**
- ✅ Company management with OIB validation
- ✅ Corporate pricing tiers
- ✅ Invoice generation
- ✅ Payment tracking

## 🚧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **Issue: "Permission denied for table"**
```sql
-- Solution: Ensure RLS policies are applied
SELECT * FROM policies WHERE tablename = 'reservations';
-- Re-run development-rls-configuration.sql if needed
```

#### **Issue: "Column does not exist"**
```sql
-- Solution: Verify schema migration completed
\d+ reservations
-- Check if all columns from strategic-database-migration.sql exist
```

#### **Issue: "No foreign key constraint"**
```sql
-- Solution: Check relationships
SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
WHERE table_name = 'reservations' AND constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';
```

#### **Issue: Real-time not working**
```sql
-- Solution: Verify publication
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
-- Should include: rooms, guests, reservations, companies, invoices, payments
```
