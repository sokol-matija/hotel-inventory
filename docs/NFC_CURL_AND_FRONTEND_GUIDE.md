# 🏷️ NFC Room Cleaning - CURL & Frontend Testing Guide

## Quick Answers to Your Questions

### ❓ Can I test with curl like this?

**YES!** Exactly like this:

```bash
# Test with room number (101, 102, etc)
curl "https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=101"

# Or with room UUID (if you have it)
curl "https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=abc-123-def"
```

✅ Both work! The function now accepts **room numbers** (101, 102, etc) or **UUIDs**

---

### ❓ Can I use the room number (101) instead of UUID?

**YES!** The Edge Function is now updated to accept:
- ✅ Room numbers: `?roomId=101`
- ✅ Room UUIDs: `?roomId=abc-123-def`

Just use whatever you want!

---

### ❓ Will this work on the NFC sticker?

**YES!** The NFC sticker will contain a URL like:

```
https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=101
```

When tapped:
1. Phone opens this URL in browser
2. Browser loads the **NFCCleanRoomPage** component
3. Component automatically calls the Edge Function
4. Shows ✅ Success or ❌ Error
5. Staff can tap "Back to Dashboard"

---

## 🧪 Testing Methods

### Method 1: curl (Instant)

```bash
# Test Room 101
curl "https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=101"

# Expected response:
# {"success":true,"message":"Room 101 marked as clean","roomNumber":"101",...}
```

**Why it works:** The Edge Function is public, no authentication needed.

---

### Method 2: Browser Direct

Just open this URL in your browser:

```
https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=101
```

You'll see JSON response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Room 101 marked as clean",
  "roomNumber": "101",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-26T10:30:00Z"
}
```

---

### Method 3: Frontend Page (Best UX)

This is what you get when NFC tag is tapped:

1. **Add route to App.tsx**

```typescript
import { NFCCleanRoomPage } from '@/components/testing/NFCCleanRoomPage'

<Route path="/nfc/clean" element={<NFCCleanRoomPage />} />
```

2. **Test the frontend**

Open this URL in browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/nfc/clean?roomId=101
```

You'll see:
- Loading spinner
- ✅ Success message with room number
- Back to Dashboard button
- Or ❌ Error message if room not found

---

## 🏷️ NFC Sticker Setup

### What goes on the sticker?

Your NFC sticker should contain this URL:

```
https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=101
```

**Note:** Change `101` to the actual room number!

### How to write to sticker?

1. Download **NFC Tools** app (free)
   - iOS: App Store
   - Android: Google Play

2. In NFC Tools:
   - Click "Write" tab
   - Click "Add a record"
   - Select "URI" type
   - Paste the URL above
   - Hold tag to phone back to write

3. Done! The tag is permanent.

## 🔧 What Was Updated

### Edge Function: `/nfc-clean-room/index.ts`

**Before:**
```
?roomId=abc-123-def  (only UUID worked)
```

**After:**
```
?roomId=101          (room number works!)
?roomId=abc-123-def  (UUID still works!)
```

**How it detects:**
- If `roomId` is all numbers → search by room **number** (101, 102, etc)
- If `roomId` has letters/dashes → search by room **UUID**

---

### Frontend: `NFCCleanRoomPage.tsx`

This is the user-facing page that opens when NFC tag is tapped:

```
Browser opens URL
         ↓
NFCCleanRoomPage loads
         ↓
Component calls Edge Function
         ↓
Shows ✅ Success or ❌ Error
         ↓
User sees beautiful UI
         ↓
Staff satisfied! 😊
```

### Scenario 3: Test with frontend page

```
Open in browser:
http://localhost:3000/nfc/clean?roomId=103

See beautiful ✅ Success page

Click "Back to Dashboard"
```

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Room 101 exists in database
- [ ] Run curl command for room 101
- [ ] Check database → is_cleaned should be true
- [ ] Add `/nfc/clean` route to App.tsx
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000/nfc/clean?roomId=102 in browser
- [ ] See ✅ Success page
- [ ] Check database → Room 102 is_cleaned should be true
- [ ] Mark a room as dirty (is_cleaned = false)
- [ ] Tap same room again
- [ ] See ✅ Success page again
- [ ] Real-time dashboard should show ✅ Clean

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### If curl returns error:

```bash
# Check response
curl -v "https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=101"

# If 404: Room not found
# Check: Does room 101 exist in database?

# If 500: Function error
# Check: Supabase logs
# Run: supabase functions logs nfc-clean-room
```

### If frontend page shows error:

1. Check browser console (F12 → Console)
2. Look for network errors
3. Check Supabase Edge Function logs
4. Verify room exists: `SELECT * FROM rooms WHERE number = '101';`

### If room not updating:

1. Check database directly
2. Try manual SQL update to verify it works
3. Check if `is_cleaned` column exists
4. Check if subscription is working
