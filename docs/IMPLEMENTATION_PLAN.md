# Hotel Management System - Implementation Plan

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Pre-Implementation Setup âœ…

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### 3.3 Additional Services (Towel Rental, Guest Addition) - Agent: `hotel-pricing-specialist`
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## Quality Assurance Process

### After Each Feature Implementation:

1. **Build Test Specialist** runs:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run type-check
   npm run lint
   npm test
   ```

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Booking creation workflow
   - Invoice generation
   - Timeline functionality
   - Database integrity

3. **Git Commit Orchestrator** creates commit:
   - Descriptive commit message
   - References implemented feature
   - Includes any database migrations needed

## Implementation Commands

### Starting Phase 1 - Feature 1.1 (Corporate Billing)
```markdown
I want to implement the Corporate Billing System (R1 Bills) as specified in the requirements document. This should include:

1. Company/Firm data model and management
2. R1 toggle in booking creation 
3. Company search and selection dropdown
4. Database integration for corporate clients

Please follow the implementation plan in docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and use the hotel-corporate-billing-specialist agent for this work.
```

### Build Testing After Feature
```markdown
Please run build tests to validate the implementation:
1. npm run build (check TypeScript compilation)
2. npm run type-check (verify type safety)  
3. npm run lint (code quality)
4. npm test (run test suite)

Use the build-test-specialist agent for comprehensive validation.
```

### Committing Successful Feature
```markdown
The corporate billing feature has been implemented and tested successfully. Please create a professional commit with:
1. Clear commit message describing the corporate billing implementation
2. Reference to the feature specification
3. Summary of files changed

Use the git-commit-orchestrator agent for this task.
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical System Preservation
- **AuthProvider**: Keep 38-line simple version - NEVER complicate
- **Croatian Fiscalization**: Preserve s004 resolution - test after changes
- **NTFY Notifications**: Maintain Room 401 notification system
- **Timeline Performance**: Monitor performance with additional features

### Rollback Plan
- Each feature is committed separately
- Can revert individual features if issues arise
- Database migrations should be reversible
- Keep backup of working state before starting

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Corporate clients can be managed (CRUD operations)
- [ ] R1 billing works end-to-end (booking to invoice)
- [ ] VAT rates correctly applied per service type
- [ ] Register selection affects fiscal processing
- [ ] Room 401 rules enforced automatically
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Build passes without errors
- [ ] No performance degradation

### Overall Project Success
- All requirements from specification implemented
- Croatian fiscal compliance maintained
- No regressions in existing features
- Performance remains acceptable
- Code quality standards maintained
