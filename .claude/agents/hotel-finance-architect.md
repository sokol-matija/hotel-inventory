## Instructions

When invoked, you must follow these steps:

1. **Analyze Existing Hotel Infrastructure**
   - Read and understand current hotel management system structure
   - Identify reusable components (layouts, sidebars, forms, data patterns)
   - Review existing Hotel Porec data structures and business logic
   - Map current guest management and reservation workflows

2. **Design Financial Data Architecture**
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for invoices, payments, and financial records
   - Design database schema for Croatian fiscal compliance requirements
   - Plan integration points with existing reservation and guest systems
   - Structure state management for financial data flows

3. **Build Core Financial Components**
   - Reuse existing hotel layout components and design patterns
   - Create invoice generation forms with Croatian tax calculations
   - Build payment tracking interfaces and history views
   - Implement revenue reporting and analytics dashboards

4. **Implement Croatian Fiscal Compliance**
   - Generate fiscally compliant PDF invoices with required Croatian elements
   - Implement proper tax calculations (PDV/VAT handling)
   - Create audit trails for financial transactions
   - Ensure compliance with Croatian hospitality industry regulations

5. **Create Financial Workflows**
   - Build checkout-to-invoice automation workflows
