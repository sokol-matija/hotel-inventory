# 🚀 NFC Room Cleaning - Immediate Testing (Right Now!)

## Test 1: CURL (Do This First - 1 Minute)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl "https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=101"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Room 101 marked as clean",
  "roomNumber": "101",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-26T10:30:00Z"
}
```

✅ **If you see this:** Your system works! Move to Test 2.

❌ **If you get error:**
- Check room 101 exists in database
- Check Edge Function is deployed
- Run: `supabase functions list`

---

## Test 2: Browser Direct (2 Minutes)

Open this URL in your browser:

```
https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=102
```

You'll see JSON in the browser. That's success!

---

## Test 3: Frontend Page (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add route to App.tsx

Find your App.tsx file and add this import:

```typescript
import { NFCCleanRoomPage } from '@/components/testing/NFCCleanRoomPage'
```

Then add this route (inside your router):

```typescript
<Route path="/nfc/clean" element={<NFCCleanRoomPage />} />
```

### Step 2: Test in browser

Open:
```
http://localhost:3000/nfc/clean?roomId=103
```

You should see:
- Loading spinner (briefly)
- ✅ Green success page with "Room 103 marked as clean"
- Back to Dashboard button

✅ **Success!** Your system is working perfectly!

---

## Test 4: Verify in Database

After each test, check your database to confirm rooms are marked clean:

```sql
SELECT number, is_cleaned, updated_at
FROM rooms
WHERE number IN ('101', '102', '103')
ORDER BY number;
```

You should see:
```
number | is_cleaned | updated_at
--------|----------|-------------------
101    | true     | 2025-10-26 10:30:00
102    | true     | 2025-10-26 10:31:00
103    | true     | 2025-10-26 10:32:00
```

---

## ✅ All Tests Passing?

Then you're ready! Here's what you have:

- ✅ Edge Function working
- ✅ API responding correctly
- ✅ Frontend page displaying results
- ✅ Database updating properly
- ✅ Room numbers working (101, 102, 103, etc)

## 🏷️ Next: Write NFC Tags (Optional)

When ready for physical deployment:

1. Buy NFC tags from Amazon (~$20 for 46)
2. Download **NFC Tools** app
3. Open NFC Tools → Write tab
4. Add record → URI
5. Paste this (change room number):
   ```
   https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=101
   ```
6. Hold NFC tag to phone back
7. Confirm write
8. Stick on room door
9. Test by tapping with phone
10. Done! 🎉

## 📞 Quick Fixes

### Curl not working?
```bash
# Make sure the URL is correct
# Room 101, not room-101
curl "https://gkbpthurkucotikjefra.supabase.co/functions/v1/nfc-clean-room?roomId=101"
```

### Frontend page 404?
```
Make sure you added the route to App.tsx:
<Route path="/nfc/clean" element={<NFCCleanRoomPage />} />
```

### Database not updating?
```sql
-- Check room exists
SELECT * FROM rooms WHERE number = '101';

-- Check is_cleaned column exists
-- It should!
```

**That's it! Test now, deploy later, profit always!** 🚀
