# ✅ Room Cleaning Automation - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

An automated system that **marks rooms as "dirty" (needs cleaning) at 7:00 AM Europe/Zagreb time** if they were occupied the previous day.

## 🏗️ Components Created

### 1. Database Layer ✅
- **PostgreSQL Function:** `reset_daily_room_cleaning()`
  - Finds rooms occupied yesterday
  - Sets `is_cleaned = false` for those rooms
  - Logs execution to audit table
  - Returns count of affected rooms

- **Audit Table:** `room_cleaning_reset_log`
  - Tracks all executions (automatic and manual)
  - Stores timestamp, rooms affected, and trigger source

- **pg_cron Job:** Scheduled at 5:00 AM UTC (7:00 AM Zagreb)
  - Runs automatically every day
  - Triggers the reset function

### 2. API Layer ✅
- **Edge Function:** `/functions/v1/reset-room-cleaning`
  - Deployed to Supabase
  - Requires authentication (JWT)
  - Manual trigger for testing
  - Returns execution results

### 3. UI Layer ✅
- **Admin Testing Page:** `/admin/testing`
  - Manual trigger button with loading states
  - Real-time execution results
  - Recent execution log (last 10)
  - Automatic/manual badge indicators

- **Sidebar Navigation:** Added "Admin Testing" link
  - TestTube icon for easy identification
  - Positioned between Settings and Hotel Modules

- **Alert Component:** Created shadcn/ui style Alert
  - Success and error variants
  - Used for displaying results

## 🚀 How to Use

### Automatic Execution
The system runs automatically every day at **7:00 AM Europe/Zagreb time**.

No manual intervention needed! 🎉

### Manual Testing

1. **Navigate to Admin Testing:**
   ```
   Sidebar → Admin Testing
   ```

2. **Trigger Manual Reset:**
   - Click "Trigger Manual Reset" button
   - Wait for execution (< 1 second)
   - View results in success alert

3. **Check Execution Log:**
   - Scroll down to "Recent Execution Log"
   - See last 10 executions
   - Automatic vs Manual badge indicators

## 🔍 How It Works

```
Day 1 (August 26):
  - Guest checks into Room 101
  - Room status: is_cleaned = true (after check-in cleaning)

Day 2 (August 27) at 7:00 AM:
  - Automated function runs
  - Detects Room 101 was occupied yesterday
  - Sets: is_cleaned = false
  - Housekeeping sees Room 101 needs cleaning

  - Guest checks out later that day
  - Housekeeper scans NFC tag
  - Room status: is_cleaned = true

Day 3 (August 28) at 7:00 AM:
  - Automated function runs again
  - Detects Room 101 was occupied yesterday
  - Sets: is_cleaned = false again
  - Cycle continues...
```

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Quick Test (2 minutes):

1. **Create test reservation:**
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   INSERT INTO reservations (guest_id, room_id, check_in_date, check_out_date, status)
   VALUES (1, 1, CURRENT_DATE - 1, CURRENT_DATE + 1, 'checked-in');

   UPDATE rooms SET is_cleaned = true WHERE id = 1;
   ```

2. **Trigger manual reset:**
   - Go to `/admin/testing`
   - Click "Trigger Manual Reset"
   - Should see "Successfully reset 1 room(s)"

3. **Verify:**
   ```sql
   SELECT room_number, is_cleaned FROM rooms WHERE id = 1;
   -- Should show is_cleaned = false
   ```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Recent Executions
```sql
SELECT * FROM room_cleaning_reset_log
ORDER BY executed_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### View pg_cron Schedule
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'reset-daily-room-cleaning';
```

### Check for Errors
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE jobid = (SELECT jobid FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'reset-daily-room-cleaning')
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## 🎨 UI Screenshots

### Admin Testing Page Features:
- ℹ️ Info alert explaining functionality
- 🔄 Manual trigger button with loading spinner
- ✅ Success/error result alerts with detailed info
- 📋 Recent execution log with badges
- 🔄 Refresh button for logs

## 🔧 Configuration

### Timezone Setting
Currently set to **Europe/Zagreb** (UTC+1/UTC+2 with DST).

The pg_cron job runs at:
- **5:00 AM UTC** = **7:00 AM Zagreb** (during summer/DST)
- **6:00 AM UTC** = **7:00 AM Zagreb** (during winter)

We chose 5:00 AM UTC to cover the peak tourism season (summer) when DST is active.

### Change Execution Time
To modify the execution time:

```sql
-- Unschedule current job
SELECT cron.unschedule('reset-daily-room-cleaning');

-- Schedule new time (example: 6:00 AM Zagreb = 4:00 AM UTC in summer)
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'reset-daily-room-cleaning',
  '0 4 * * *',  -- New UTC time
  $$SELECT reset_daily_room_cleaning('automatic');$$
);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Function not running automatically
**Solution:** Check pg_cron job status
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'reset-daily-room-cleaning';
```

### Issue: Manual trigger fails
**Solution:** Ensure you're logged in. Check browser console for errors.

### Issue: No rooms being reset
**Solution:** Verify there are occupied rooms
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT room_id) FROM reservations
WHERE check_in_date <= (CURRENT_DATE - 1)
  AND check_out_date >= (CURRENT_DATE - 1)
  AND status NOT IN ('cancelled', 'no-show');
```
